# This application takes a NOAA GOES Proton Flux text file (ftp://ftp.swpc.noaa.gov/pub/lists/particle/), converts the #
# data to a pandas dataframe, iterates through the rows of the dataframe one-by-one, checking for values in the P>10,  #
# P>30, P>50, and P>100 columns to see if the flux level has gone above the predetermined thresholds. If it has, it    #
# will trigger a Warning (flux > 1), Alert (flux>10), or Critical (flux>100) email and make a POST request to an API.  #
# Additionally, if the flux level has returned to below 1 (flux<1) for at least 90 minutes, it will trigger an Info    #
# email and make a POST request to the API. With each email it attaches an up-to-date plot with the information up     #
# until that point in time.                                                											                       #
#																							                                                          						   #
# Few things to note:                                                                                                  #
# 1) There is an "installLibs.sh" file that comes with this program - it should be used to install necessary libraries #
#																												                                                          	   #
# 2) If the flux level is consistently above a certain threshold, it will send emails/make POST requests repeatedly.   #
#     This is by design, since the idea is that each new entry will be a new update from the weather satellite		     #
#																							                                                          						   #
# 3) The email is configurable, so the details will need to be added in the 'tools.py' file, under the "sendEmail"     #
#     method. The "To", "From", "password", and server "smtplib.SMTP(<server>, <port>)" details would change           #
#     Additionally, I created 'skysatops06@gmail.com' just for testing purposes - please feel free to use it! :)       #
#																							                                                          						   #
# 4) Similarly, the API Post URL is configurable, but will need to be changed in the 'tools.py' file                   #
#																							                                                          						   #
# 5) The text input can be designed in many ways - as of now I have set it to take input via the cmd line in the form  #
#     of a human written text, however the line below it in the comments is there incase a script would be run. Once   #
#     replaced with the "input" line, the bash/cmd line entries should be as follows: 				                         #
#     python3 mainApp.py <NOAA GOES Proton Flux filename>															                                 #
#                                                                                                                      #
#           Thank you for this opportunity and I hope the app works well on your ubuntu system! :)                     #
